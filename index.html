        <p id="about">Hello! My name is Collin Strauch, and I am a transfer student dual majoring in Game Design 
            and Game Programming at University of Advancing Technology. I transferred to University of Advancing 
            Technology after studying Game Design and Development at Rochester Institute of Technology for three years.
            <br><br>Growing up, my favorite hobby has always been playing video games. I liked all sorts of 
            different video games, and I was always eager to play something new. By the time I got to high school, 
            I wanted to learn coding and programming so I can make video games, and I loved it. By combining my 
            logical thinking with my creativity, I was able to create some amazing things. Now as a programmer in 
            university, I have a burning passion for programming, and I am always excited to create new games.

            <h2>Knock-Out Arcade<br>Production Studio</h2>
            <p>
                Knock-Out Arcade is a 2D fighting game made in Game Maker Studio 2 with the Game Maker language.
                <br><br>This was a Production Studio project, meaning it was a student-run project pitched for other 
                students to work on in a class. Different students get onboarded across semesters, and I was onboarded 
                as a programmer during the project's second semester running.
                <br><br>During my time working on the project, I quickly established myself as a teammate that was 
                dedicated to make the project as good as possible with the time I had to work on it. I communicated 
                frequently with the project lead, the designers, and the other programmers to get a firm grasp of the 
                overall vision of the project and what needed to be done.
                <br><br>Even though I wasn't classified as a lead in the project, the other programmers often came to me 
                for help on their tasks and I helped them. Rather than doing the tasks for them, I taught them the best 
                ways for them to do their tasks and gave them a starting point to work off of whenever they got stuck.

            <h2>World View<br>UAT Game Design Workshop Jam, March 2023</h2>
            <p>World View is an arcade-style twin-stick shooter created in a group of 4. You play as a ship shooting 
                various things, such as rocks and fish, as the camera zooms out and you learn that the environment you are in 
                isn't what it seems at first.
                <br><br>World View was created in Unity using C# as the scripting language.
                <br><br>The art entirely consists of 2D sprites.
