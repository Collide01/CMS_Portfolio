                    Knock-Out Arcade is a 2D fighting game made in Game Maker Studio 2 with the Game Maker language.
                    <br><br>This was a Production Studio project, meaning it was a student-run project pitched for other 
                    students to work on in a class. Different students get onboarded across semesters, and I was onboarded 
                    as a programmer during the project's second semester running.
                    <br><br>During my time working on the project, I quickly established myself as a teammate that was 
                    dedicated to make the project as good as possible with the time I had to work on it. I communicated 
                    frequently with the project lead, the designers, and the other programmers to get a firm grasp of the 
                    overall vision of the project and what needed to be done.
                    <br><br>Even though I wasn't classified as a lead in the project, the other programmers often came to me 
                    for help on their tasks and I helped them. Rather than doing the tasks for them, I taught them the best 
                    ways for them to do their tasks and gave them a starting point to work off of whenever they got stuck.

                    The Cursed Men and The Stolen Princess is a 2.5D RPG made in Unreal using Blueprints.
                    <br><br>This was a Production Studio project, meaning it was a student-run project pitched for other 
                    students to work on in a class. Different students get onboarded across semesters, and I was onboarded 
                    as a programmer during the project's first semester running.
                    <br><br>Since I usually work on gameplay and player controls, I wanted to focus on different aspects 
                    of the project this time around. I created the dialogue system and set up the quest system. The data 
                    for both of these are held in data tables and spreadsheets, allowing designers to fill information 
                    easily.
                    <br><br>I kept frequent contact with the rest of the team through weekly standups to update our 
                    progress. Whenever someone started to fall behind, we tried to help them in order to stay on schedule.
