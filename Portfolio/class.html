            <h2>AVERT<br>RIT First Year, Spring Semester</h2>
            <p>This is a puzzle game that uses a grid and you have to place a bunch of shapes on the grid to make a laser
                bounce and hit the target. This was made using MonoGame in Visual Studio. I teamed up with 3 other students 
                to make this, and my role in this project was the lead programmer. As such, I had to develop a lot of the 
                functionality of the game. The main thing that I learned from this project was how to work with other people 
                to make a game, since was my very first group project. There were a lot of challenges thrown at us during the 
                making of this game. One of our bigger ones was figuring out how to make the levels work. I decided to create 
                an external tool that helped with making the levels and we programmed the levels from there. Download and play

            <h2>Fort Turtle<br>RIT Second Year, Fall Semester</h2>
            <p>This is less of a game and more of a demonstration of my 3D modeling skills. I created this scene with 2
                other people and we created different parts of the scene. I created the turtle statue and trees, and I 
                put the scene together by assembling the fort and using fog and snow to create the atmosphere. The 
                only real challenges presented to us was learning how to use Maya to make the models and use Unity to put 
                the scene together, since we were new to it at the time. Download and check it out

            <h2>GIPHY Finder<br>RIT Second Year, Fall Semester</h2>
            <p>This is a web service designed for users to be able to find GIFs that they are looking for and do basic
                functions like copying their links and adding them to favorites. This was developed using HTML, CSS, a lot
                of JavaScript, and the GIPHY API. I designed and developed this site myself. During the making of this
                project, I learned how loading in assets from a search API works, and how I can use that to enhance the user
                experience on the site. One of the biggest challenges that I faced with making this site is figuring out how
                to get all of the functions to work. Learning how to make the search function work was challenging on its
                own, but getting all of the other features to work alongside it was even more challenging. But one by one, I
                figured out how to make each function work and now the site is entirely functional. Check it out

            <h2>Space Invaders: The Bizarro Dimension<br>RIT Second Year, Fall Semester</h2>
            <p>This game is similar to the classic Space Invaders, but there are a lot of twists thrown into this game that
                makes it unique in its own way. This game was made using JavaScript and the external libraries PixiJS,
                Howler, and Google WebFonts. I designed and developed this game by myself. I learned a lot of things about
                Javascript as I was making this game, and now I know how I can use it to make games. I think one of the
                biggest challenges with this project was getting everything to work properly. Making a big game like this
                leaves room for a lot of bugs, and I had to playtest a lot in order to get rid of as many of them as
                possible. In the end, I am very proud of this silly little game that I made and I had a lot of fun making it.

            <h2>Talisman of Ethshar<br>RIT Third Year, Fall Semester</h2>
            <p>This is a puzzle game set around the world of Ethshar from the open-ended series of fantasy stories by Lawrence 
                Watt-Evans. This game is about connecting dots in specific patterns to create talismans, and was made in Unity. 
                As I was in a team of 5, my primary role in this project was creating the overall look of the game, including 
                the special effects that appear when the player wins. I mainly learned how to import assets into a Unity project and use them 
                effectively. Click this <a href="https://play.unity.com/mg/other/talisman-of-ethshar">link</a> to play it.</p>

            <h2>Breath of the Wild Hyrule Compendium<br>RIT Third Year, Spring Semester</h2>
            <p>This is a comprehensive web service designed for users to access any and all items and entities that are
                located in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. This was developed using HTML, CSS, a lot of JavaScript, 
                and an API of the Hyrule Compendium in the game. I designed and developed this site myself. During the
                making of this project, I learned how to use web components in multiple pages, use Bulma CSS, and use
                Google Firebase to allow users to upload some of their favorite items to a server. I faced a lot of challenges
                during the making of this site. I had to learn how to use Bulma to set the layout of my site and design it
                so that it's readable on all screen sizes. I also had to figure out how to incorporate Google Firebase into
                my site. However, I overcame these challenges and I am particularly proud of this site. Check it out

            <p>This is a rougelike where you play as a farmer and you fight against vegetable monsters. This game 
                was made using C# in Unity. I teamed up with 3 other people for this project, and I designed and 
                animated all of the enemies and bosses. I also programmed different AI and attack patterns for each 
                enemy. As such, I learned how to use the Unity animator in depth and how to use abstract and virtual 
                methods to create different enemies. Click this

            <h2>Pursuit ~ Visualizer<br>RIT Third Year, Spring Semester</h2>
            <p>This was one of the last projects that I worked on at RIT before I transferred, and this is easily 
                one of my favorite projects from that school. This is a web application that allows the user to 
                listen to music and interact with on-screen effects that move along with the music. I chose to theme 
                this application after Ace Attorney because I was a huge fan of it at the time and its music is 
                phenomenal. I used everything that I've learned from developing the Breath of the Wild Hyrule 
                Compendium and I cranked the style of this application up to 11, making the aesthetics extremely 
                faithful to the source material it was based on. I did face some new challenges with this project too, 
                such as how to create multiple channels of audio to play multiple sounds at once and how to make 
                this application fully functional with all screen sizes. Check it out

            <h2>Flying Eyeing<br>UAT First Year, Fall Semester</h2>
            <p>This project was made for a class where students had to make a game every week. The theme for one week was 
                B-Movie Monsters, where we had to make a game in the style of old B-Movie horror films. I decided to 
                take the assets from one of my other games, The Flow of Time, and restructure it so you play as the 
                monster and now you chase after humans. I polished the game to give it the aesthetic of an old B-Movie, 
                from the intentionally bad title to the grayscale shading over the whole game. I did not face any major 
                challenges with developing this game.

            <h2>The Flow of Time<br>UAT First Year, Fall Semester</h2>
            <p>This project was also made for the same class where students had to make a game every week. However, there was one 
                week where students were allowed to polish a previous game. For me, that project was The Flow of Time. 
                It's a quick top-down shooter, and it has a unique mechanic that allows time manipulation. The 
                player can speed up and slow down time as they please, and everything is affected except for 
                certain objects. Figuring out how to create the time manipulation mechanic was a bit difficult, 
                but once I figured it out, everything started falling into place and the rest of the project went 
                smoothly.

            <h2>Blind Jumping<br>UAT First Year, Fall Semester</h2>
            <p>This is a 3D platformer, where you can't see anything except for what's immediately in front of you 
                and you have to navigate through the platformer using sound. I worked in a team of three for this 
                project over the course of the semester, and I was the lone programmer for it the entire way through. 
                On top of having to navigate through the map blind, we also decided to add a dash of horror to add 
                flavor to the dark atmosphere. As such, I included sections where the player would land on a field 
                and they would be chased by a monster. There were many challenges that I had to overcome to make 
                this project work, such as making spacial sound work, fine-tuning the character controller, and 
                making the enemies scary enough to enforce the horror without making them too difficult to avoid.
