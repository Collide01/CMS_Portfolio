                    <p>
                        Space Invaders: The Bizarro Dimension is a top-down shooter resembling the original Space
                        Invaders, created individually. Similarly to the original Space Invaders, you shoot aliens, but
                        there are a number of twists that make this game extremely different from the original.
                        <br><br>I only had two weeks to develop this project, but I had a lot of ideas going into it.
                        This project piggybacked off of some previous assignments for a class, so I had the foundation
                        for the code already.
                        <br><br>I wrote a project proposal detailing the story, the aesthetics, and some overall
                        features of the game. I also drew some rough sketches showing the game layout. As I worked on
                        the project, I documented my progress in the form of a journal. I recorded what I worked on each
                        day and my methodology for everything I did. I also kept a list of outside references and assets
                        that were pulled and modified for this project.

                    <h2>Blind Jumping</h2>
                    <p><u>Role</u>: Programmer, Level Designer, Enemy Designer</p>
                    <p>Blind Jumping is a 3D platformer created in a group of 3, where you can't see anything except for what's immediately in front of you 
                        and you have to navigate through the game using sound. I was mainly the programmer for it, but I also handled 
                        enemy and level design.
                        <br><br>We had about 9 weeks to develop this project. We started with an idea for creating a game 
                        that would somehow link audio with colors so that different sounds/pitches produce different colors and 
                        vice versa. However, we struggled to design an actual game around that, so we simplified it by 
                        making a platformer where the player is blind and they navigate with sound effects.
                        <br><br>Admittedly, we made up most of our ideas on the fly. The level design, the enemy design, and 
                        even the horror aesthetic weren't even conceived of in the planning phase of the game. However, we 
                        got by thanks to scrum and good task management through Trello. We had a paper prototype of the 
                        concept and we wrote a retrospective for each sprint detailing what we did, what we struggled with, 
                        and what lessons we learned.

                    <p><u>Role</u>: Individual</p>
                    <p>
                        Discovery is a complete adventure made in a Legend of Zelda quest editor called ZQuest.
                        <br><br>I had high ambitions for this project, as I wanted to expand out from creating a single
                        dungeon and create a full Zelda adventure on the same scale as the original Legend of Zelda.
                        This was only my second project on the ZQuest engine too, so I still had a lot to learn about
                        the engine as I worked on this.
                        <br><br>Before I started developing this quest, I drew a paper map that showed the overall
                        layout of the world, showed the intended locations of multiple different entities, paths, and
                        dungeons, and showed the critical path that the player should follow to beat it. I received a
                        lot of feedback on this design and the item locations in the final project are a little different from
                        the paper map to better fit the gameplay.
                        <br><br>The quest contains a narrative that serves as the backstory and the primary motivator
                        for the quest. The dialogue from NPCs also give the player hints about where to go or what items
                        they need. Progression in this quest is tied to the items, as many areas can only be accessed
                        with specific items. Several items that can be found in the quest are also optional and they
                        merely serve to help the player beat the game more easily. Most of these optional items can be
                        found in areas that the player doesn't have access to when they pass by them for the first time.
                        This rewards exploration and paying attention to the environment.

                        unfamiliar with, such as camera manipulation outside of simple panning and controller support.
                        The controller support in particular was the biggest challenge for me to overcome for this
                        project because I had to program the player controls around it.

                        GitHub is not well-suited for Unreal. Thanks to prior knowledge and experience, we split up our work 
                        so none of us worked on the same files at the same time. This minimized the amount of merge conflicts 
                        and it kept the project running smoothly.

                        what parts of the project we work on. However, for this one, we discussed the code's
                        architecture before actually programming it. We organized the class hierarchy and utilized
                        advanced coding features such as interfaces for encapsulation. We unfortunately spent too much
                        time on the planning phase to develop some of it, but we didn't run into any issues with what we
                        worked on thanks to that planning.

                        <br><br>The overworld was separated into 9 different sections to give it a lot of variety, and I 
                        worked on 1 or 2 of those sections each week. I set up the overall layout of the overworld and 
                        the dungeons first and then I went back and polished them afterward. I had a rough idea of what 
                        I wanted the story to be like from the outset, and I wrote the finer details as I worked on the 
                        project. The dungeons were the only part of this map design that I made up as I went. I wanted 
                        to keep them shallow so I could focus more on the overworld, but I made them more interesting as 
                        I worked on the project and learned new things about ZQuest.

                    <p><u>Role</u>: Designer</p>
                    <p>This Game Jam was unique in that it was 24 hours long instead of 48 and we worked on a card game instead of a video game. 
                        Because of this, I was able to focus on game design since programming wasn't involved. I worked in a group of 9, and all 
                        of us knew each other since we worked on the same production studio project. The card game that we ended up developing 
                        was a deck-building card game, where we gather cards and build up our decks in order to gather medals and win. I 
                        contributed to a number of aspects about our game, such as overall card balance, game flow, and game mechanics, all of 
                        which were written and documented on white boards. 
                        <br><br>Much of the focus for our discussions were on the implications of the mechanics. Since this 
                        was a card game about Veterans Day and the army, we wanted to respect them without glorifying 
                        tragedy or war and avoid possible negative implications, such as buying medals instead of earning them. 
                        Much of the overall game design revolved around avoiding these.

                        <br><br>I was a programmer for this project, but I created multiple documents to explain how 
                        the mechanics I programmed work and why I programmed them the way I did. This helped the lead and 
                        the designers understand how the mechanics worked and how they could be used in the moment-to-moment 
                        gameplay.
                        <br><br>I specifically made documents for the <a href="media/koaRushCancel.pdf" target=”_blank”>Rush Cancel mechanic</a>

                        <br><br>Four of us were programmers for this game, so we divided the work based on how much experience 
                        we had with using Unreal. One team member was very experienced with the engine while the rest of us just started 
                        learning it. So, we divided the work as so: I worked on the core mechanic of the game, which was growing 
                        roots through the ground, one person worked on level design and importing art assets, another person worked 
                        on the UI, and the experienced programmer worked on everything else.
                        <br><br>Since we were all programmers, we helped each other by giving tips on how to program a feature or to 
                        exchange tasks whenever someone is finished with their part of the development. We also had trouble with setting up 
                        a repository for the game, so we had to pass around a flash drive and manually merge all of our work that way, which 
                        also means we frequently told each other what exactly we worked on so each merge would go smoothly.
                        <br><br>In the end, we successfully built the entire game before the deadline.

                        onboarded as a programmer during the project's second semester running.
                        <br><br>During my time working on the project, I quickly established myself as a teammate that
                        was dedicated to make the project as good as possible with the time I had to work on it. I

                        came to me for help on their tasks and I helped them. Rather than doing the tasks for them, 
                        I taught them the best ways for them to do their tasks and gave them a starting point to work

                        that guard the big golden ship as well as red enemy ships.
                        <br><br>After completing the game, players are presented with a flashy scene of the golden ship
                        exploding and then are presented the win screen. The win screen changes depending on how much
                        health the player has when they win. If they lose, they are sent to a lose screen and are given
                        the option to retry the game.

                        Vitamin Deficiency is a top-down rougelike created by a group of 4. In this game, you play as a
                        farmer, shooting mutated vegetables that are causing havoc.
                        <br><br>Inheritance was used to create the enemies. There is a base class that all enemy classes
                        are
                        children of, which contains shared information such as max health, move speed, different AI
                        states,
                        and different functions to perform for each state. Specific methods are overridden to make each
                        type
                        of enemy attack and move differently.
                        <br><br>The bosses are a unique case in that they have different phases depending on how much
                        health
                        they have. As such, they have their own state machines determining which phase they are
                        currently
                        in, and that dictates their AI patterns and attacks.
                        <br><br>All animations for each enemy is handled by Unity's built-in animation system. The
                        animations themselves are hand-drawn by me and are imported into the project as sprite sheets.
                        This
                        gives me control over each animation with how quickly they animate and it allows me to use
                        animation
                        events to manipulate their AI so they smoothly change from one state to another.

                        <br><br>To prevent the player from moving outside of light, a Blueprint actor was created for a
                        spotlight source. This Blueprint actor uses raycasting to measure the player's location in
                        relation
                        to the spotlight. This also allows obstructions to block the ray and limit the size of the light
                        and
                        the amount of space the player can walk.
                        <br><br>This code was written to be modular as well so it can be used in items. There are
                        certain
                        items in the game that emit light and can be carried around. These dynamically changes where the

                        Talisman of Ethshar is a puzzle game created by a group of 5. It's themed around the world
                        of Ethshar from the open-ended series of fantasy stories by Lawrence Watt-Evans. To solve the
                        puzzles, you draw lines to connect dots in particular patterns in a single stroke to create
                        talismans.
                        <br><br>While my team and I were working on this game, we got to a point where the game worked
                        fine
                        but it didn't look appealing. We were supposed to be constructing magical talismans, but
                        instead, it
                        just looked like we were connecting dots.
                        <br><br>To solve this issue, I did two things to add the magical appeal to the game. The first
                        thing
                        that I did was add particle effects to show that the talismans emitted magic when drawn
                        correctly.
                        The second thing that I did was change the color of the lines that were drawn once the talisman
                        was
                        correctly drawn to show that the ink used to draw the lines has magical properties too, and they
                        were activated once the talisman was drawn correctly.
                        <br><br>These additions helped to establish that the player was creating something magical,
                        which
                        was the intended theme of this game.

                        Knock-Out Arcade is a 2D fighting game made in Game Maker Studio 2 with the Game Maker language.
                        I
                        helped development for this project as a programmer when it was pitched to Production Studio.
                        <br><br>When I was working on this project, one of our main goals was to properly implement
                        projectiles. Only one character at the time had a projectile and it was hard-coded. If we wanted
                        multiple characters to use projectiles, it would be difficult to implement that because of this
                        issue.
                        <br><br>One of the previous programmers developed a character editor with C# to streamline
                        character
                        creation for the designers, so I started there with the implementation. I programmed an
                        extension
                        for the program that reimplements a lot of its code to allow designers to create projectiles. I
                        added a lot of unique data for the projectiles that specifies how they would function too.
                        <br><br>Once the character editor was done, I worked on the game itself to implement all of that
                        new
                        data. One of our biggest issues at this point was that hitstop was global, meaning both players
                        would pause for a bit if anyone got hit, not just the player that got hit. This would be
                        detrimental
                        to the overall game flow with projectiles, so our project lead, Ryland Kealey, fixed that for me
                        as
                        I worked on the projectiles.
                        <br><br>This new implementation of projectiles is far more robust and flexible than before, and
                        it
                        makes it much easier for designers to implement them.

                        data
                        for both of these are held in data tables and spreadsheets, allowing designers to fill
                        information
                        easily.
                        <br><br>I kept frequent contact with the rest of the team through weekly standups to update our
                        progress. Whenever someone started to fall behind, we tried to help them in order to stay on
                        schedule.
