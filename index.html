        <p id="about">Hello! My name is Collin Strauch, and I am a transfer student dual majoring in Game Design 
            and Game Programming at University of Advancing Technology. I transferred to UAT after studying Game 
            Design and Development at Rochester Institute of Technology for three years.
            <br><br>Growing up, my favorite hobby has always been playing video games. I liked all sorts of 
            different video games, and I was always eager to play something new. By the time I got to high school, 
            I wanted to learn coding and programming so I can make video games, and I loved it. By combining my 
            logical thinking with my creativity, I was able to create some amazing things. Now as a programmer in 
            university, I have a burning passion for programming, and I am always excited to create new games.
