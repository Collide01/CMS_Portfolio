                    dedicated to make the project as good as possible with the time I had to work on it. I communicated 
                    frequently with the project lead, the designers, and the other programmers to get a firm grasp of the 
                    overall vision of the project and what needed to be done.
                    <br><br>Even though I wasn't classified as a lead in the project, the other programmers often came to me 
                    for help on their tasks and I helped them. Rather than doing the tasks for them, I taught them the best 
                    ways for them to do their tasks and gave them a starting point to work off of whenever they got stuck.

                    stop you too.

                    <br><br>The art is entirely consisted of 2D sprites and a shader was used for the grayscale screen to make

                    they must do to take it down. The main game has the player fly a blue ship, shooting the purple turrets

                    the option to retry the game.

                    <br><br>To prevent the player from moving outside of light, a Blueprint actor was created for a spotlight source. 
                    This Blueprint actor uses raycasting to measure the player's location in relation to the spotlight. This also allows 
                    obstructions to block the ray and limit the size of the light and the amount of space the player can walk.
                    <br><br>This code was written to be modular as well so it can be used in items. There are certain items in the 
                    game that emit light and can be carried around. These dynamically changes where the player can walk, and this creates 
                    more possibilities for puzzles.

                    Talisman of Ethshar is a puzzle game created by a group of 5. It's themed around the world 
                    of Ethshar from the open-ended series of fantasy stories by Lawrence Watt-Evans. To solve the puzzles, you draw 
                    lines to connect dots in particular patterns in a single stroke to create talismans.
                    <br><br>While my team and I were working on this game, we got to a point where the game worked fine but it didn't 
                    look appealing. We were supposed to be constructing magical talismans, but instead, it just looked like we were connecting 
                    dots.
                    <br><br>To solve this issue, I did two things to add the magical appeal to the game. The first thing that I 
                    did was add particle effects to show that the talismans emitted magic when drawn 
                    correctly. The second thing that I did was change the color of the lines that were drawn once the talisman was 
                    correctly drawn to show that the ink used to draw the lines has magical properties too, and they were activated 
                    once the talisman was drawn correctly.
                    <br><br>These additions helped to establish that the player was creating something magical, which was the intended 
                    theme of this game.
