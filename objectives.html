                    Discovery is a complete adventure made in a Legend of Zelda quest editor called ZQuest.
                    <br><br>I had high ambitions for this project, as I wanted to expand out from creating a single dungeon and 
                    create a full Zelda adventure on the same scale as the original Legend of Zelda. This was only my second 
                    project on the ZQuest engine too, so I still had a lot to learn about the engine as I worked on this.
                    <br><br>Before I started developing this quest, I drew a paper map that showed the overall layout of the 
                    world, showed the intended locations of multiple different entities, paths, and dungeons, and showed the critical 
                    path that the player should follow to beat it. I received a lot of feedback on this design and the layout 
                    in the final project is a little different from the paper map to better fit the gameplay.
                    <br><br>The quest contains a narrative that serves as the backstory and the primary motivator for 
                    the quest. The dialogue from NPCs also give the player hints about where to go or what items they need. 
                    Progression in this quest is tied to the items, as many areas can only be accessed with specific items. 
                    Several items that can be found in the quest are also optional and they merely serve to help the player 
                    beat the game more easily. Most of these optional items can be found in areas that the player doesn't have 
                    access to when they pass by them for the first time. This rewards exploration and paying attention to the 
                    environment.

                    <br><br>In order to play this quest, you need to download ZQuest and the .qst file for it. Go to 
                    <a href="https://zquestclassic.com/releases/" target=”_blank”>this link</a> and download ZQuest version 2.55 Alpha 120 
                    (That's the version I developed it for). In the files, there should be a Quests folder. Download the .qst

                    simple panning and controller support. The controller support in particular was the biggest challenge 
                    for me to overcome for this project because I had to program the player controls around it.

        <div class="text">
            <p>
                In the Advanced Level Design class, we had weekly discussions about level (and game) design in different genres. 
                In these discussions, we discussed our opinion of the genre, what we feel defines a "good game" in the genre, and 
                some good and bad examples of the genre.
                <br><br>This is the post that I made about the stealth genre:
                <br>All stealth games have a simple objective: accomplish the goal while staying out of sight. The games themselves 
                will add nuance to this with the level design and the behavior of the AI. These kinds of games require you to plan 
                out your course of action on the fly as you navigate through the levels and avoid getting spotted. I'm not that good 
                at these kinds of games, but I respect these games for their interesting and unique level design and mechanics.
                <br>I think a good stealth game has to be challenging and make you use your brain. Stealth encounters don't want you 
                to blitz through the level like it's a hack and slash, so the mechanics and level design need to prevent that. At the 
                same time, the game needs to give you a certain amount of tools that can help you complete the level while making the 
                game fun.
                <br>I know Metal Gear Solid is the creme de la creme of stealth games, but I don't have any personal experience with 
                those games. So instead, I'll talk about the Batman Arkham games, as I think the stealth levels in those games are 
                phenomenal. Every stealth level follows the same pattern in terms of layout: Batman starts off out of sight in a big 
                room, and all of the enemies are standing or slowly walking around with guns. Batman doesn't have any sort of 
                resistance to guns since he's only human, so getting spotted and shot at will put Batman in serious danger. This 
                incentivizes the player to avoid getting spotted. In order to take down the enemies, the player has access to a 
                wide range of tools and gadgets. This gives the player a lot of freedom in how they want to take down the enemies. 
                At the same time, these tools have to be used wisely because most of them won't outright take down enemies for you, 
                only stunning them long enough for you to take them down yourself. Levels may also provide a number of routes for 
                the player to use, such as through vents and grates. Players can use these paths to perform surprise attacks or make 
                quick getaways, but if an enemy spots Batman using one of these hidden paths, they will stay aware of them for the 
                rest of the encounter, essentially blocking them off as stealth routes. All of these factors combine to make stealth 
                levels in the Batman Arkham games intense, thrilling, and fun.
                <br>As much as I like the Insomniac Spider-Man games, I think the stealth segments in those games are kind of a joke 
                in comparison to the Batman Arkham games (I'm talking about Spider-Man stealth, not the MJ or Miles segments from the 
                first game). My main problem with them is that they are too easy. Spider-Man has ton of freedom of movement, which 
                makes it easy to stay out of the enemies' sights. Across both the first game and Miles Morales, Spider-Man has a ton 
                of tools that allow him to take down enemies from far away, making it basically pointless to sneak up behind them. 
                By far the most egregious aspect of the stealth in these games is that when you scan the environment, the game will 
                straight-up tell you if it's safe to take down an enemy. Now you don't have to be aware of your surroundings when 
                taking down an enemy, you can just take them down if the game tells you ‘yes’. All of these factors make stealth in 
                these Spider-Man games unsatisfying and boring. Also, unless stealth is required for a mission, stealth in these 
                games is completely pointless because you can fight the enemies normally by dodging bullets and throwing their guns 
                around. Why would I want to sneak around and slowly pick off enemies when I could use the more fun route and blitz 
                through them?

                    <br><br>To prevent the player from moving outside of light, a Blueprint actor was created for a spotlight source. 
                    This Blueprint actor uses raycasting to measure the player's location in relation to the spotlight. This also allows 
                    obstructions to block the ray and limit the size of the light and the amount of space the player can walk.
                    <br><br>This code was written to be modular as well so it can be used in items. There are certain items in the 
                    game that emit light and can be carried around. These dynamically changes where the player can walk, and this creates 
                    more possibilities for puzzles.

                    Talisman of Ethshar is a puzzle game created by a group of 5. It's themed around the world 
                    of Ethshar from the open-ended series of fantasy stories by Lawrence Watt-Evans. To solve the puzzles, you draw 
                    lines to connect dots in particular patterns in a single stroke to create talismans.
                    <br><br>While my team and I were working on this game, we got to a point where the game worked fine but it didn't 
                    look appealing. We were supposed to be constructing magical talismans, but instead, it just looked like we were connecting 
                    dots.
                    <br><br>To solve this issue, I did two things to add the magical appeal to the game. The first thing that I 
                    did was add particle effects to show that the talismans emitted magic when drawn 
                    correctly. The second thing that I did was change the color of the lines that were drawn once the talisman was 
                    correctly drawn to show that the ink used to draw the lines has magical properties too, and they were activated 
                    once the talisman was drawn correctly.
                    <br><br>These additions helped to establish that the player was creating something magical, which was the intended 
                    theme of this game.

                    Blind Jumping is a 3D platformer where you navigate through a platform 
                    level by using sound, since your vision is obscured, and it is hard to see what is ahead.
                    <br><br>Blind Jumping was created in Unity using C# as the scripting language.
                    <br><br>The game utilizes a variety of different sounds, as well as Unity's 3D sound settings and features, 
                    to direct or misdirect players through the level. The different sounds help players identify things and the 
                    3D sound features help players locate things without seeing them.

                    Knock-Out Arcade is a 2D fighting game made in Game Maker Studio 2 with the Game Maker language.
                    <br><br>This was a Production Studio project, meaning it was a student-run project pitched for other 
                    students to work on in a class. Different students get onboarded across semesters, and I was onboarded 
                    as a programmer during the project's second semester running.
                    <br><br>During my time working on the project, I quickly established myself as a teammate that was 
                    dedicated to make the project as good as possible with the time I had to work on it. I communicated 
                    frequently with the project lead, the designers, and the other programmers to get a firm grasp of the 
                    overall vision of the project and what needed to be done.
                    <br><br>Even though I wasn't classified as a lead in the project, the other programmers often came to me 
                    for help on their tasks and I helped them. Rather than doing the tasks for them, I taught them the best 
                    ways for them to do their tasks and gave them a starting point to work off of whenever they got stuck.
