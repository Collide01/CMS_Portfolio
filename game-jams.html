        <h2><u>Spring Steel Spring Ninja</u>
            <br>UAT Founder's Game Jam, September 2022
            <br>Theme: Spring
            <br>Award won: Best Audio</h2>
        <p>This was my first Game Jam game. I worked in a group of 8 to create a platformer with stealth elements. 
            I was the only programmer for this project because I was the only one with experience in programming in 
            Unity. As such, I was the one who put the game together and made the entire game functional. One of the 
            biggest Unity features that I learned how to use was how to carry data from one scene to another, and 
            this would become very useful for later Jams. My biggest challenge with this game was animating with 3D 
            models. We used 3D models to animate the characters, and the process was a little bit different from 
            animating 2D sprites. The biggest hurdle to overcome with animating the character was that the character 
            would be rotated during certain animations for some reason, and I had to figure out how to fix it.

            <br>Theme: Liquid
            <br>Awards won: Best Design, Best Audio, Most Polished</h2>
        <p>I was in my comfort zone when developing this game. I worked in a group of 6 to create an endless-scrolling 
            top-down shooter in the vein of classic arcade games. Once again, I was the only programmer for this 
            project, but the project was much more simple to develop this time around. I used my newfound knowledge of 
            transferring data from one scene to another to create a leaderboard, which enhances the arcade aesthetic that 
            we were going for. I didn't face any major challenges during this project.

            <br>Global Game Jam, February 2023
            <br>Theme: Roots
            <br>Award won: Best Audio</h2>
        <p>For this Jam game, I experiemnted with an engine that I wasn't familiar with: Unreal Engine. I worked in 
            a group of 10 to create a 2D puzzle platformer. Four of us were programmers, and my role as one of those 
            programmers was to program the main mechanic of the game, which was growing roots in and through the 
            ground. Since this was an engine that I was unfamiliar with, simply creating this mechanic, as well as 
            anything else that I programmed, was a huge challenge. I learned how to use Unreal the most during this 
            Game Jam, and I continued learning it from there so I can start developing games with it.

            <br>UAT Game Design Workshop Jam, March 2023
            <br>Theme: Deception
            <br>Awards won: Best Audio, Most Technical</h2>
        <p>I teamed up with some especially incredible teammates for this one. I worked in a group of 4 to create 
            a unique arcade-style twin stick shooter. Two of us were programmers. I worked on the gameplay itself 
            and the teammate worked on the menus. Since I was back in my comfort zone with Unity again, I wanted 
            to incorporate some features that I was unfamiliar with, such as camera manipulation outside of 
            simple panning and controller support. The controller support in particular was the biggest challenge 
            for me to overcome for this project because I had to program the player controls around it.
