                <h2>AVERT<br>RIT First Year, Spring Semester</h2>
                <p class="hide">This is a puzzle game that uses a grid and you have to place a bunch of shapes on the grid to make a laser
                    bounce and hit the target. This was made using MonoGame in Visual Studio. I teamed up with 3 other students 
                    to make this, and my role in this project was the lead programmer. As such, I had to develop a lot of the 
                    functionality of the game. The main thing that I learned from this project was how to work with other people 
                    to make a game, since was my very first group project. There were a lot of challenges thrown at us during the 
                    making of this game. One of our bigger ones was figuring out how to make the levels work. I decided to create 
                    an external tool that helped with making the levels and we programmed the levels from there. Download and play

                </p>
                <p>AVERT is a puzzle game created in a group of 4. In this game, you use mirrors to bounce a laser 
                    towards a goal. 
                    <br><br>AVERT was created using a C# framework called MonoGame, the framework used to create Stardew Valley.
                    <br><br>The art is very simplistic, using only basic shapes and lines.
                    <br><br>I wouldn't consider this game to be a worthy portfolio piece, but I included it because this is my 
                    first group project and I want to show how much I grew over time as a game developer.

                    other people and we created different parts of the scene. I created the turtle statue and trees, and I 
                    put the scene together by assembling the fort and using fog and snow to create the atmosphere. The 
                    only real challenges presented to us was learning how to use Maya to make the models and use Unity to put

                    experience on the site. One of the biggest challenges that I faced with making this site is figuring out how
                    to get all of the functions to work. Learning how to make the search function work was challenging on its
                    own, but getting all of the other features to work alongside it was even more challenging. But one by one, I
                    figured out how to make each function work and now the site is entirely functional. Check it out

                    biggest challenges with this project was getting everything to work properly. Making a big game like this
                    leaves room for a lot of bugs, and I had to playtest a lot in order to get rid of as many of them as
                    possible. In the end, I am very proud of this silly little game that I made and I had a lot of fun making it.

                <h2>Talisman of Ethshar<br>RIT Third Year, Fall Semester</h2>

                    Watt-Evans. This game is about connecting dots in specific patterns to create talismans, and was made in Unity. 
                    As I was in a team of 5, my primary role in this project was creating the overall look of the game, including 
                    the special effects that appear when the player wins. I mainly learned how to import assets into a Unity project and use them 
                    effectively. Click this <a href="https://play.unity.com/mg/other/talisman-of-ethshar">link</a> to play it.

                <p>
                    Talisman of Ethshar is a puzzle game created by a group of 5. It's themed around the world 
                    of Ethshar from the open-ended series of fantasy stories by Lawrence Watt-Evans. To solve the puzzles, you draw 
                    lines to connect dots in particular patterns in a single stroke to create talismans.
                    <br><br>While my team and I were working on this game, we got to a point where the game worked fine but it didn't 
                    look appealing. We were supposed to be constructing magical talismans, but instead, it just looked like we were connecting 
                    dots.
                    <br><br>To solve this issue, I did two things to add the magical appeal to the game. The first thing that I 
                    did was add particle effects to show that the talismans emitted magic when drawn 
                    correctly. The second thing that I did was change the color of the lines that were drawn once the talisman was 
                    correctly drawn to show that the ink used to draw the lines has magical properties too, and they were activated 
                    once the talisman was drawn correctly.
                    <br><br>These additions helped to establish that the player was creating something magical, which was the intended 
                    theme of this game.

                    making of this project, I learned how to use web components in multiple pages, use Bulma CSS, and use

                    during the making of this site. I had to learn how to use Bulma to set the layout of my site and design it
                    so that it's readable on all screen sizes. I also had to figure out how to incorporate Google Firebase into

                    and whether it is a regular room, the starting room, or the boss room. The starting room can have as many 
                    entryways as needed, so all of the other rooms are placed around it. An algorithm is used to determine if the doors 
                    for each room connect to each other so that the entire map is interconnected. Finally, the boss room is set to 
                    only have one door, so it would usually be placed on a distant part of the map.

                    This was one of the last projects that I worked on at RIT before I transferred, and this is easily 
                    one of my favorite projects from that school. This web application allows the user to

                    this application after Ace Attorney because I was a huge fan of it at the time and its music is 
                    phenomenal. I used everything that I've learned from developing the Breath of the Wild Hyrule 
                    Compendium and I cranked the style of this application up to 11, making the aesthetics extremely 
                    faithful to the source material it was based on. I did face some new challenges with this project too, 
                    such as how to create multiple channels of audio to play multiple sounds at once and how to make

                <h2>Flying Eyeing<br>UAT First Year, Fall Semester</h2>
                <p class="hide">This project was made for a class where students had to make a game every week. The theme for one week was 
                    B-Movie Monsters, where we had to make a game in the style of old B-Movie horror films. I decided to 
                    take the assets from one of my other games, The Flow of Time, and restructure it so you play as the 
                    monster and now you chase after humans. I polished the game to give it the aesthetic of an old B-Movie, 
                    from the intentionally bad title to the grayscale shading over the whole game. I did not face any major 
                    challenges with developing this game.

                    eyeball designed like a B-Movie monster and you attack humans. Some of them will fire at you with guns to 
                    stop you too.

                    week where students were allowed to polish a previous game. For me, that project was The Flow of Time. 
                    It's a quick top-down shooter, and it has a unique mechanic that allows time manipulation. The 
                    player can speed up and slow down time as they please, and everything is affected except for 
                    certain objects. Figuring out how to create the time manipulation mechanic was a bit difficult, 
                    but once I figured it out, everything started falling into place and the rest of the project went 
                    smoothly.

                    project over the course of the semester, and I was the lone programmer for it the entire way through. 
                    On top of having to navigate through the map blind, we also decided to add a dash of horror to add 
                    flavor to the dark atmosphere. As such, I included sections where the player would land on a field 
                    and they would be chased by a monster. There were many challenges that I had to overcome to make 
                    this project work, such as making spacial sound work, fine-tuning the character controller, and 
                    making the enemies scary enough to enforce the horror without making them too difficult to avoid.

                <p>
                    Wizzrobe Wonders is a small adventure made in a Legend of Zelda quest editor called ZQuest.
                    <br><br>Since The Legend of Zelda was particularly famous for its puzzles, I wanted to focus on that 
                    for this project. This was my first project with this game engine and I had 5 weeks to make it, so I 
                    wanted to start small with a side quest and a dungeon.
                    <br><br>Before I started developing this quest, I drew a paper map that showed the overall layout of the 
                    dungeon, showed the intended locations of every item, door and enemy, and showed the critical path that the 
                    player should follow to beat it. I received a lot of feedback on this design and the layout in the final 
                    project is a little different from the paper map to better fit the gameplay.
                    <br><br>The quest contains a narrative that serves as the backstory and the primary motivator for 
                    the quest. The dungeon itself also has lore that is established through text and enemy design. Several 
                    items can be found in this quest to help the player beat the dungeon and complete the quest.
                    <br><br>In order to play this quest, you need to download ZQuest and the .qst file for it. Go to 
                    <a href="https://zquestclassic.com/releases/">this link</a> and download ZQuest version 2.55 Alpha 120 
                    (That's the version I developed it for). In the files, there should be a Quests folder. Download the .qst 
                    file <a href="media/WizzrobeWonders.qst" download>here</a> and put it in that folder. Then, open the 
                    zplayer executable, create a profile, and choose the quest. Now you can play it!

                <p>
                    Discovery is a complete adventure made in a Legend of Zelda quest editor called ZQuest.
                    <br><br>I had high ambitions for this project, as I wanted to expand out from creating a single dungeon and 
                    create a full Zelda adventure on the same scale as the original Legend of Zelda. This was only my second 
                    project on the ZQuest engine too, so I still had a lot to learn about the engine as I worked on this.
                    <br><br>Before I started developing this quest, I drew a paper map that showed the overall layout of the 
                    world, showed the intended locations of multiple different entities, paths, and dungeons, and showed the critical 
                    path that the player should follow to beat it. I received a lot of feedback on this design and the layout 
                    in the final project is a little different from the paper map to better fit the gameplay.
                    <br><br>The quest contains a narrative that serves as the backstory and the primary motivator for 
                    the quest. The dialogue from NPCs also give the player hints about where to go or what items they need. 
                    Progression in this quest is tied to the items, as many areas can only be accessed with specific items. 
                    Several items that can be found in the quest are also optional and they merely serve to help the player 
                    beat the game more easily. Most of these optional items can be found in areas that the player doesn't have 
                    access to when they pass by them for the first time. This rewards exploration and paying attention to the 
                    environment.
                    <br><br>In order to play this quest, you need to download ZQuest and the .qst file for it. Go to 
                    <a href="https://zquestclassic.com/releases/">this link</a> and download ZQuest version 2.55 Alpha 120
