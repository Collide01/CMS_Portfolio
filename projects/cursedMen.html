        <p><u>Role</u>: Systems Programmer, Repository Manager</p>
        <p><u>Platform</u>: PC</p>
        <p><u>Software</u>: Unreal, Trello</p>
        <p><u>Project Description</u>: The Cursed Men and The Stolen Princess is a 2.5D RPG made in Unreal using 
            Blueprints. This game is unique in that it focuses on language-learning by teaching players Spanish.
        </p>
        <p>This was a Production Studio project, meaning it was a student-run project pitched for other 
            students to work on in a class. Different students get onboarded across semesters, and I was onboarded 
            as a programmer during the project's first semester running.

        <p>Since I usually work on gameplay and player controls, I wanted to focus on different aspects 
            of the project this time around. I created the dialogue system and set up the quest system. The data 
            for both of these are held in data tables and spreadsheets, allowing designers to fill information 
            easily. I was also the most experienced on the team with repository management, so I set up the 
            repo using GitHub and held a meeting with all of the programmers to instruct them on how to use it.
        </p>
        <p>The dialogue system is supposed to contain both English and Spanish words. I created a data table 
            listing all of the necessary information that allows for NPCs to speak in both languages. I also set 
            up a Google Spreadsheet that designers can fill out for the dialogue and then download it as a .csv 
            to import into Unreal. Then the .csv could be imported into Unreal as a data table. After that was 
            set up, I
            made the dialogue system so that each word can be clicked to translate between English and Spanish. 
            If there is a word or phrase that the player doesn't know, they play a multiple choice minigame to 
            guess the correct translation.

        <p>The quest tool was set up at the very end of the semester. It contained tons of data that the designers 
            could fill out and it provided a general sense of what would go into the quests and how in-depth they 
            would be. It was all set up so that the designers and the programmers could plug in the information 
            and make it work in later semesters after I signed off of the project.

        <p>I kept in frequent contact with the rest of the team through weekly standups to update our 
            progress, online work sessions to work with the other programmers, and occasional hangout/party 
            days. Whenever someone started to fall behind, we tried to help them in order to stay on schedule. 
            Overall, there was a better sense of teamwork and unity here than in all of my other projects.
