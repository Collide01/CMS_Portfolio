            <p class="hide">This was my first Game Jam game. I worked in a group of 8 to create a platformer with stealth elements. 
                I was the only programmer for this project because I was the only one with experience in programming in 
                Unity. As such, I was the one who put the game together and made the entire game functional. One of the 
                biggest Unity features that I learned how to use was how to carry data from one scene to another, and 
                this would become very useful for later Jams. My biggest challenge with this game was animating with 3D 
                models. We used 3D models to animate the characters, and the process was a little bit different from 
                animating 2D sprites. The biggest hurdle to overcome with animating the character was that the character 
                would be rotated during certain animations for some reason, and I had to figure out how to fix it.

                project, but the project was much more simple to develop this time around. I used my newfound knowledge of 
                transferring data from one scene to another to create a leaderboard, which enhances the arcade aesthetic that 
                we were going for. I didn't face any major challenges during this project.

            <p class="hide">For this Jam game, I experimented with an engine that I wasn't familiar with: Unreal Engine. I worked in 
                a group of 10 to create a 2D puzzle platformer. Four of us were programmers, and my role as one of those 
                programmers was to program the main mechanic of the game, which was growing roots in and through the 
                ground. Since this was an engine that I was unfamiliar with, simply creating this mechanic, as well as 
                anything else that I programmed, was a huge challenge. I learned how to use Unreal the most during this 
                Game Jam, and I continued learning it from there so I can start developing games with it.

                to places that have largely abandoned it, such as cities and factories.
                <br><br>Four of us were programmers for this game, so we divided the work based on how much experience 
                we had with using Unreal. One team member was very experienced with the engine while the rest of us just started 
                learning it. So, we divided the work as so: I worked on the core mechanic of the game, which was growing 
                roots through the ground, one person worked on level design and importing art assets, another person worked 
                on the UI, and the experienced programmer worked on everything else.
                <br><br>Since we were all programmers, we helped each other by giving tips on how to program a feature or to 
                exchange tasks whenever someone is finished with their part of the development. We also had trouble with setting up 
                a repository for the game, so we had to pass around a flash drive and manually merge all of our work that way, which 
                also means we frequently told each other what exactly we worked on so each merge would go smoothly.
                <br><br>In the end, we successfully built the entire game before the deadline.

                and the teammate worked on the menus. Since I was back in my comfort zone with Unity again, I wanted 
                to incorporate some features that I was unfamiliar with, such as camera manipulation outside of 
                simple panning and controller support. The controller support in particular was the biggest challenge 
                for me to overcome for this project because I had to program the player controls around it.

            <p>This Game Jam was really well organized. I worked in a group of 5 as one of the two programmers and

                GitHub is not well-suited for Unreal. Thanks to prior knowledge and experience, we split up our work 
                so none of us worked on the same files at the same time. This minimized the amount of merge conflicts 
                and it kept the project running smoothly.

                by saying what parts of the project we work on. However, for this one, we discussed the code's 
                architecture before actually programming it. We organized the class hierarchy and utilized advanced coding 
                features such as interfaces for encapsulation. We unfortunately spent too much time on the planning phase to 
                develop some of it, but we didn't run into any issues with what we worked on thanks to that planning.
