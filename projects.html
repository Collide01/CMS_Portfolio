                <h2>Breath of the Wild Hyrule Compendium<br>RIT Third Year, Spring Semester</h2>
                <p class="hide">This is a comprehensive web database designed for users to access any and all items and entities that are
                    located in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. This was developed using HTML, CSS, a lot of JavaScript, 
                    and an API of the Hyrule Compendium in the game. I designed and developed this site myself. During the
                    making of this project, I learned how to use web components in multiple pages, use Bulma CSS, and use
                    Google Firebase to allow users to upload some of their favorite items to a server. I faced a lot of challenges
                    during the making of this site. I had to learn how to use Bulma to set the layout of my site and design it
                    so that it's readable on all screen sizes. I also had to figure out how to incorporate Google Firebase into
                    my site. However, I overcame these challenges and I am particularly proud of this site. Check it out 
                    <a href="https://people.rit.edu/cms5882/330/project-1/" target=”_blank”>here</a>.

                    The Breath of the Wild Hyrule Compendium is a web service created individually. It is a 
                    website designed to function like the Hyrule Compendium in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. As such, 
                    it also contains the same information and this website makes it easier to search of specific items.
                    <br><br>This website was created using an API with all of the item information and Google Firebase to hold 
                    data from multiple users. HTML and CSS were used to design the site and JavaScript was the scripting language. 
                    JSON was also used to hold individual data.
                    <br><br>The design is composed of images, fonts, and color schemes themed around the game.

                    This was one of the last projects that I worked on at RIT before I transferred, and this is easily 
                    one of my favorite projects from that school. This web application allows the user to 
                    listen to music and interact with on-screen effects that move along with the music. I chose to theme 
                    this application after Ace Attorney because I was a huge fan of it at the time and its music is 
                    phenomenal. I used everything that I've learned from developing the Breath of the Wild Hyrule 
                    Compendium and I cranked the style of this application up to 11, making the aesthetics extremely 
                    faithful to the source material it was based on. I did face some new challenges with this project too, 
                    such as how to create multiple channels of audio to play multiple sounds at once and how to make 
                    this application fully functional with all screen sizes.

                    according to the music.
                    <br><br>Pursuit ~ Visualizer was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. JSON was used to store some data.
