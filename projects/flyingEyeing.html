        <p><u>Project Description</u>: This project was made for a class where students had to make a game every week. The theme for one week was 
            B-Movie Monsters, where we had to make a game in the style of old B-Movie horror films. I decided to 
            take the assets from one of my other games, The Flow of Time, and restructure it so you play as the 
            monster and now you chase after humans. I polished the game to give it the aesthetic of an old B-Movie, 
            from the intentionally bad title to the grayscale shading over the whole game. I did not face any major 
            challenges with developing this game.</p>
