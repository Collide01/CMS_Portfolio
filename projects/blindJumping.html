        <p><u>Role</u>: Main Programmer, Level Designer</p>
        <p><u>Platform</u>: PC</p>
        <p><u>Software</u>: Unity, Trello</p>
        <p><u>Project Description</u>: Blind Jumping is a 3D platformer where you navigate through a platform 
            level by using sound, since your vision is obscured, and it is hard to see what is ahead.
            <br><br>I worked in a group of 3 and we had about 9 weeks to develop this project. We started with an idea for creating a game 
            that would somehow link audio with colors so that different sounds/pitches produce different colors and 
            vice versa. However, we struggled to design an actual game around that, so we simplified it by 
            making a platformer where the player is blind and they navigate with sound effects.
            <br><br>Admittedly, we made up most of our ideas on the fly. The level design, the enemy design, and 
            even the horror aesthetic weren't even conceived of in the planning phase of the game. However, we 
            got by thanks to scrum and good task management through Trello. We had a paper prototype of the 
            concept and we wrote a retrospective for each sprint detailing what we did, what we struggled with, 
            and what lessons we learned.
            <br><br>The game utilizes a variety of different sounds, as well as Unity's 3D sound settings and features, 
            to direct or misdirect players through the level. The different sounds help players identify things and the 
            3D sound features help players locate things without seeing them.</p>
