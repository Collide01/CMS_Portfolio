        <p><u>Role</u>: Programmer/Level Designer</p>
        <p><u>Platform</u>: PC</p>
        <p><u>Software</u>: Unity</p>
        <p><u>Project Description</u>: Blind Jumping is a 3D platformer where you navigate through a platform 
            level by using sound, since your vision is obscured, and it is hard to see what is ahead.
            <br><br>I worked in a group of 3 for this and we had about 13 weeks to work on this project. Our initial idea was to create a game that somehow linked visual cues such as color with audio cues such as pitch. We constantly debated on how to design a game around this and we were not making much progress. Ultimately, we considered our time frame and decided that it would be best to simplify the idea by focusing on one of those aspects. We went with sound.
            <br><br>As the 
            <br><br>The game utilizes a variety of different sounds, as well as Unity's 3D sound settings and features, 
            to direct or misdirect players through the level. The different sounds help players identify things and the 
            3D sound features help players locate things without seeing them.</p>
