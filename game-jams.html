                <p class="hide">This was my first Game Jam game. I worked in a group of 8 to create a platformer with stealth elements. 
                    I was the only programmer for this project because I was the only one with experience in programming in 
                    Unity. As such, I was the one who put the game together and made the entire game functional. One of the 
                    biggest Unity features that I learned how to use was how to carry data from one scene to another, and 
                    this would become very useful for later Jams. My biggest challenge with this game was animating with 3D 
                    models. We used 3D models to animate the characters, and the process was a little bit different from 
                    animating 2D sprites. The biggest hurdle to overcome with animating the character was that the character 
                    would be rotated during certain animations for some reason, and I had to figure out how to fix it.

                    top-down shooter in the vein of classic arcade games. Once again, I was the only programmer for this 
                    project, but the project was much more simple to develop this time around. I used my newfound knowledge of 
                    transferring data from one scene to another to create a leaderboard, which enhances the arcade aesthetic that 
                    we were going for. I didn't face any major challenges during this project.

                    a group of 10 to create a 2D puzzle platformer. Four of us were programmers, and my role as one of those 
                    programmers was to program the main mechanic of the game, which was growing roots in and through the 
                    ground. Since this was an engine that I was unfamiliar with, simply creating this mechanic, as well as 
                    anything else that I programmed, was a huge challenge. I learned how to use Unreal the most during this 
                    Game Jam, and I continued learning it from there so I can start developing games with it.

                    <br><br>Four of us were programmers for this game, so we divided the work based on how much experience 
                    we had with using Unreal. One team member was very experienced with the engine while the rest of us just started 
                    learning it. So, we divided the work as so: I worked on the core mechanic of the game, which was growing 
                    roots through the ground, one person worked on level design and importing art assets, another person worked 
                    on the UI, and the experienced programmer worked on everything else.
                    <br><br>Since we were all programmers, we helped each other by giving tips on how to program a feature or to 
                    exchange tasks whenever someone is finished with their part of the development. We also had trouble with setting up 
                    a repository for the game, so we had to pass around a flash drive and manually merge all of our work that way, which 
                    also means we frequently told each other what exactly we worked on so each merge would go smoothly.
                    <br><br>In the end, we successfully built the entire game before the deadline.

                    <br><br>To prevent the player from moving outside of light, a Blueprint actor was created for a spotlight source. 
                    This Blueprint actor uses raycasting to measure the player's location in relation to the spotlight. This also allows 
                    obstructions to block the ray and limit the size of the light and the amount of space the player can walk.
                    <br><br>This code was written to be modular as well so it can be used in items. There are certain items in the 
                    game that emit light and can be carried around. These dynamically changes where the player can walk, and this creates 
                    more possibilities for puzzles.

                    Because of this, I was able to focus on game design since programming wasn't involved. I worked in a group of 9, and all 
                    of us knew each other since we worked on the same production studio project. The card game that we ended up developing 
                    was a deck-building card game, where we gather cards and build up our decks in order to gather medals and win. I 
                    contributed to a number of aspects about our game, such as overall card balance, game flow, and potential implications 
                    based on the game mechanics. The last point was especially important since the game was meant to respect veterans in 
                    the army and we didn't want to have any game mechanics that would seemingly "disrespect" them.

                    Crescent Beast's Balancing Act is a 3D endless runner created in a group of 5. The player must avoid 
                    obstacles heading their way and avoid falling off the unicycle. Crescent Beast is livestreaming the event and 
                    the chat reacts to how the player is doing.
                    <br><br>Crescent Beast's Balancing Act was created in Unreal using Blueprints as the scripting language.
                    <br><br>The art entirely consists of 3D models.

                <p class="hide">This was probably the most unique Game Jam for me. I worked in a group of 6 as one of the three programmers and we 
                    used Unity to make the project. For every Game Jam before this one, I organized my work with the other programmers 
                    by saying what parts of the project we work on. However, for this one, we discussed the code's 
                    architecture before actually programming it. We organized the class hierarchy and utilized advanced coding 
                    features such as interfaces for encapsulation. We unfortunately spent too much time on the planning phase to 
                    develop some of it, but we didn't run into any issues with what we worked on thanks to that planning.
