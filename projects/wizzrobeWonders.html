            In order to play this quest, you need to download ZQuest and the .qst file for it. Go to 
            <a href="https://zquestclassic.com/releases/" target=”_blank”>this link</a> and download ZQuest version 2.55 Alpha 120 
            (That's the version I developed it for). In the files, there should be a Quests folder. Download the .qst 
            file <a href="media/downloadables/WizzrobeWonders.qst" download>here</a> and put it in that folder. Then, open the 
            zplayer executable, create a profile, and choose the quest. Now you can play it!

        <p><u>Project Description</u>: Wizzrobe Wonders is a small adventure made in a Legend of Zelda quest editor called ZQuest.
            <br><br>Since The Legend of Zelda was particularly famous for its puzzles, I wanted to focus on
            that for this project. This was my first project with this game engine and I had 5 weeks to make
            it since it was a class project, so I wanted to start small with a side quest and a dungeon.
            <br><br>Before I started developing this quest, I drew a paper map that showed the overall
            layout of the dungeon, showed the intended locations of every item, door and enemy, and showed
            the critical path that the player should follow to beat it. I received a lot of feedback on this
            design and the layout in the final project is a little different from the paper map to better
            fit the gameplay.
            <br><br>The quest contains a narrative that serves as the backstory and the primary motivator for 
            the quest. The dungeon itself also has lore that is established through text and enemy design. Several 
            items can be found in this quest to help the player beat the dungeon and complete the quest.
