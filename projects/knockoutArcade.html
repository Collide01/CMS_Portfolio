        <p><u>Role</u>: Gameplay Programmer, Software Engineer</p>
        <p><u>Platform</u>: PC</p>
        <p><u>Software</u>: Game Maker Studio 2, Visual Studio, Adobe After Effects, Trello</p>
        <p><u>Project Description</u>: Knock-Out Arcade is a 2D fighting game made in Game Maker Studio 2 with the Game Maker language. 
            An accompanying character editor software was created in Visual Studio with C#.
            <br><br>This was a Production Studio project, meaning it was a student-run project pitched for other 
            students to work on in a class. Different students get onboarded across semesters, and I was onboarded 
            as a programmer during the project's second semester running.
            <br><br>During my time working on the project, I quickly established myself as a teammate that was 
            dedicated to make the project as good as possible with the time I had to work on it. I communicated 
            frequently with the project lead, the designers, and the other programmers to get a firm grasp of the 
            overall vision of the project and what needed to be done.
            <br><br>Even though I wasn't classified as a lead in the project, the other programmers often came to me 
            for help on their tasks and I helped them. Rather than doing their tasks for them, I taught them the best 
            ways for them to do their tasks and gave them a starting point to work off of whenever they got stuck.
        </p>

        <p>I made a large number of gameplay mechanics in this game. Two examples of which are the Rush Cancel 
            and the Spirit mechanic for one of the characters. Documents explaining their design and how they work 
            are shown below.

        <p><b>Code Snippet</b>: This function is for speed trails. It's modular so that this can be plugged 
            into the player class whenever an action calls for it.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>
function SpeedTrail(setStartingOpacity, setFadeSpeed, interval)
{
	// For each interval of the speed timer.
	if (speedTrailTimer >= interval)
	{
		speedTrailTimer = 0;
		object_set_sprite(oSpeedTrail, sprite_index);
		var speedTrailInstance = instance_create_layer(x, y, "Instances", oSpeedTrail);
		
		with (speedTrailInstance)
		{
			image_index = other.image_index;
			
			image_xscale = other.image_xscale;
			
			// Set up the palette data for the speed trail
			if (array_length(other.selectedCharacter.BasePalette) > 0)
			{
				hasColorPalettes = true;
				if (other.playerID == 1)
				{
					PaletteSetup(global.p1PaletteID, other.selectedCharacter);
				}
				else
				{
					PaletteSetup(global.p2PaletteID, other.selectedCharacter);
				}
			}
			else
			{
				hasColorPalettes = false;
			}
			
			// Initialize variables
			startingOpacity = setStartingOpacity;
			fadeSpeed = setFadeSpeed;
			initialized = true;
		}
	}
	
	// Increment the speed trail timer
	speedTrailTimer++;
}
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>The speedTrailInstance refers to the oSpeedTrail object class. Here is its Step function.</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
if (!initialized)
{
	image_alpha = startingOpacity;
}
else 
{
	// Fade the sprite
	image_alpha = clamp(image_alpha - fadeSpeed, 0, 1);
	
	// Destroy the sprite once completely invisible
	if (image_alpha <= 0)
	{
		instance_destroy();
	}
}

        <p>There is a corresponding character editor that a previous programmer made in Visual Studio with C#. 
            I worked on this character editor to add a large number of new features, options, and data for preexisting 
            mechanics and new ones too. The data gets saved in JSON files, which are then imported into the game 
            itself. There are separate JSON files for each character and projectile.
        </p>
        <p>Some of the features and data I added include but are not limited to:
            <ul>
                <li>Special Move Data</li>
                <li>Spirit Data</li>
                <li>Options for Multiple Movesets</li>
                <li>Projectile Data</li>
                <li>Sound Data</li>
                <li>Frame-By-Frame Hitbox/Hurtbox Viewer</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p><b>Code Snippet</b>: This is for the character editor. Most of my contributions to it build off of 
            preexisting code and I copied the format. For example, here is the data model for super attacks.

        <p>I also made a few trailers for this game. They weren't part of my tasks, but I just wanted to make 
            them because I was that passionate about this project. This was my first 
            time learning about video creation and editing. I used Adobe After Effects for these. In retrospect, 
            I think I need to improve my audio mixing above all else, because these videos are LOUD.
